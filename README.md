# SMS Fix Magisk Module for Samsung Galaxy A53 5G

A Magisk module that fixes incoming SMS on Galaxy A53 5G by rolling back the RIL libraries to those from firmware `A536BXXU6CWE9` (start of June 2023).

**⚠️ This fix likely only works for Exynos devices.**

**⚠️ Do not install this module if you don't have problems receiving texts, or if you are on firmware `A536BXXU6CWE9` or earlier.**

## Installation
Download the [latest version](https://github.com/mytja/a536x-ril-rollback/releases/latest) and flash it on the Magisk app or a custom recovery.
